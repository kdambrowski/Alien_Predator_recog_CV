# **Image Classification with PyTorch**
This project is an image classification model using PyTorch that can classify images into two classes: predators and aliens. The model uses convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and is trained on a dataset of images using various data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance.

## **Installation**
To use this project, you must have Python 3 installed. You can then clone the repository from GitHub and install the required dependencies using pip:  
- pip install kaggle  
- pip install validators  
- pip install gradio  
 
**The required dependencies include:**
 
cv2: OpenCV library for image processing  
matplotlib: Data visualization library for plotting graphs and images  
numpy: Numerical computing library  
pandas: Data manipulation library for handling data in tabular form  
google.colab: Google Colab library for working with Colab notebooks  
gradio: A web interface for interacting with the model  
torch: PyTorch library for building and training deep learning models  
torchvision: PyTorch library for computer vision tasks  


## **Dataset**
The dataset used to train the model is a collection of images of predators and aliens, with labels indicating the class of each image. The dataset is available on Kaggle and can be downloaded using the Kaggle API.
